# Golang Simple Project Make Rest API Using Gin,Gorm & MySQL

**Gin** is a web framework for the Go programming language that makes it easy for us to create web services such as APIs. We will also be using **Gorm** as its database system.

By using Gin and Gorm together, you can build web applications quickly and easily, as well as make database connections more efficient and effective.

**PlanetScale** is a cloud-native database platform designed for modern applications. It is a relational database that is built on top of Vitess, an open-source sharding and scaling system for MySQL. I'm also using PlanetScale as my database in this Project.

## Requirement :
- Gin ( github.com/gin-gonic/gin )
- Gorm ( gorm.io/gorm )
- MySQL Cloud (PlanetScale) as a Database
- Postman

# Coming Soon
I made this a simple project Golang CRUD integrating with Rest API

## What's the features ?
